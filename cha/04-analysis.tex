\section{Image Size}
We were able to create a minimal \ac{OS} image with the Azure IoT Edge runtime
using \textit{reUpNix}. To achieve this, we created \textit{Nix} derivations
and modules for the \textit{Azure IoT Edge} runtime and the \textit{Azure IoT Edge
Identity Service}. We also created a \textit{Nix} derivation for the \ac{ADU} Agent.
Microsoft has the source code for the previously mentioned components
publicly available on GitHub, so we could build the \textit{Nix} packages directly
from source, which is written in Rust and C and uses Cargo and CMake respectively.
For the third-party dependencies, namely \textit{libc}, \textit{libtss}, \textit{libcurl} and
\textit{openssl}, of the \textit{Azure IoT Edge} runtime, we used
the already existing \textit{Nix} packages from the \textit{Nixpkgs} repository.
By using the existing \textit{Nix} packages, we could ensure that the dependencies
are linked with the correct paths in the \textit{Nix} store, and can be reused
by other \textit{Nix} packages.
Further, we had to add the already existing \textit{Nix} package for \textit{Docker}
to the system configuration, since it is required by \textit{Azure IoT Edge}.
However, it is not a hard dependency, in case the user want to exchange \textit{Docker}
with \textit{Moby} or \textit{Podman}, which are also able to run \ac{OCI}-compliant
container images.

Finally, since \textit{reUpNix} removes some unnecessary
Kernel modules, we had to add Kernel modules back to the system configuration in order
to be able to run \textit{Docker}.
Most notably, we had to add the kernel modules
\textit{br\_netfilter}, \textit{xt\_nat} and \textit{8021q} to the system configuration,
since they are required for \textit{Docker} networking.

We compared \textit{reUpNix}, \textit{NixOS 23.01}, \textit{Ubuntu 22.04}, and
\textit{Yocto Kirkstone} by their installed image size, with the methodology introduced
in chapter \ref{sec:image-size}. All system images feature an \ac{OCI}-compliant container runtime
and the Azure IoT Edge runtime. The results of the comparison are shown in table \ref{tab:image-size}.

\noindent
We can see from table \ref{tab:image-size} that with its 1,289 Megabytes
\textit{reUpNix} has a 43\% smaller base image size than Microsoft's recommended
\textit{Ubuntu 22.04}. It is also 45\% smaller than the base image size of
\textit{NixOS 23.01}, which shows that the minification process is very effective
in minimizing the size of the \ac{OS} on disk despite having a fully working
Azure IoT Edge runtime installed.
To further illustrate the differences in size, refer to figure \ref{fig:image-size}.

      };

\caption{Image size by OS in Megabytes}
\label{fig:image-size}
\end{figure}

\noindent
In contrary, the difference in image size between \textit{Ubuntu 22.04} and
\textit{NixOS} is only 62 Megabytes, which is unsurprising, since both are
general purpose \textit{Linux} distributions and not specifically designed
for embedded and \ac{IoT} systems. The largest image in this comparison is
\textit{Yocto Kirkstone}, which is 2,634 Megabytes larger than \textit{Ubuntu 22.04}.
However, it features no effort to minimize the size of the \ac{OS} and it
just contains a default development configuration of the \textit{Yocto Project}
for \textit{Azure IoT Edge}. We can see that our hypothesis that \textit{reUpNix}
is by far the smallest \ac{OS} in this comparison is confirmed. The minification
process is effective and \textit{reUpNix} is a viable option for \ac{IoT} devices
running \textit{Azure IoT Edge} with limited storage capacity. Even if we would
update \textit{reUpNix} with an A/B partitioning scheme, which is not the proposed
methodology, the update size would be smaller, and we would still have less data
transmitted in comparison to the other \ac{OS}.

\subsection{Podman}
Podman is a container runtime developed by Red Hat and a direct competitor to Docker.
In the future it would be interesting to investigate the possibility of using
Podman instead of Docker as the container runtime for Azure IoT Edge. Podman is
not officially supported by Microsoft, but it can potentially be used as a
replacement for Docker, since it can provide a \ac{UDS} for the IoT Edge runtime
to communicate with the container runtime \cite{book:3556946,msdoc-supportetplatforms}.
In a quick comparison made with an unminified \textit{NixOS} image, we found that
using \textit{Podman} instead of \textit{Docker} would reduce the image size by
15\%. However, \textit{Podman} does not run on \textit{reUpNix} out of the box,
we would have to invest some effort to investigate which components to add to
\textit{reUpNix} to make \textit{Podman} work.

\section{Update size}
In the previously section we have already discussed that we were able to create
\textit{Nix} packages for the \textit{Azure IoT Edge} runtime and its dependencies.
Since we have establish that \textit{reUpNix} can be used to create a minimal
\ac{OS} image for \textit{Azure IoT Edge}, we can now compare the update size
when updating with \textit{reUpNix}'s differential updates to the update size
when updating in an A/B partitioning scheme. Both methods can be used
with \ac{ADU} Agent, with the exception that for \textit{reUpNix} the \ac{ADU}
needs to use a script handler to apply the update, while for A/B partitioning
the built-in \ac{ADU} handler can be used. We wanted to compare the update size
for an update which changes the majority of packages in the system, so we
picked a \textit{Nixpkgs} version from November 1st, 2023 as the base and March 16th,
2024 as the target upstream. The results of the comparison are shown in table
\ref{tab:update-size}.

\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{l|l|l}
	\toprule
		Operating System & Image Variation 1 & $\Delta$ Ubuntu\\
	\midrule
    \textbf{reUpNix} & \text{206 MB} & \color{ba-green}{- 1 928 MB} \\
    \textbf{NixOS 23.01} & \text{XXXX MB} & \textcolor{ba-red}{+ XX MB} \\
    \textbf{Ubuntu 22.04} & \text{2 134 MB} & \text{-} \\
    \textbf{Yocto Kirkstone} & \text{4 717 MB} & \textcolor{ba-red}{+ 2 583 MB} \\
	\bottomrule
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Update size by OS for each variation}
  \label{tab:update-size}
\end{table}

\noindent
We can clearly see that \textit{reUpNix} has a 90.3\% smaller update size
than \textit{Ubuntu 22.04}, which is a significant improvement. Applying the
differential update methodology of \textit{reUpNix} to \ac{IoT} devices
running \textit{Azure IoT Edge}, will significantly reduce the amount of data
transmitted in comparison to using A/B partitioning. This is important for
devices with a limited Internet connection, and it enables a more frequent updating.

\end{figure}

\noindent
In figure \ref{fig:update-size} we can see yet again how large the difference
in size is and that \textit{reUpNix} is the most efficient \ac{OS} in this comparison.
Using \textit{reUpNix} for \ac{IoT} devices running \textit{Azure IoT Edge}
instead of Microsoft's recommended \textit{Ubuntu 22.04} will significantly reduce
the data transmitted when updating the \ac{OS} and the \textit{Azure IoT Edge} runtime.

\section{Time To Recover}
In order to verify that the \textit{reUpNix} system can recover from a reboot
in an acceptable time frame, we measured the time it takes for the system to
reboot and send a message via the \textit{Azure IoT Edge Hub} with the proposed
methodology from chapter \ref{sec:time-to-recover}. We used the first message
that the \textit{Edge Agent} sends to the \textit{Edge Hub} after a reboot as
a measure, because this message includes the timestamp when it was sent.
The \textit{Edge Agent} immediately sends an update message to the \textit{Azure
IoT Hub} to signal that the device is online. We repeated the same experiment
for all of the \ac{OS}, namely \textit{reUpNix}, \textit{NixOS 23.01},
\textit{Ubuntu 22.04}, and \textit{Yocto Kirkstone}. The results of the comparison
can be seen in table \ref{tab:timetorecover} and figure \ref{fig:timetorecover}.

and \textit{Ubuntu 22.04} respectively.}

\caption{Number of Measurements by Duration}
\label{fig:timetorecover}
\end{figure}
\noindent
We can see from the results that \textit{reUpNix} has on average the fastest time
to recover, from the four \ac{OS} we tested, even if we account for the different
delays that are configured for the bootloader. So our hypothesis that \textit{reUpNix}
and \textit{NixOS} will provide no significant delay in the boot process due to
the \textit{Nix} package manager, is confirmed. The two \ac{OS} using the
\textit{Nix} package manager have a similar, or better, time to recover as the \ac{OS}
which use a traditional file system and directory structure, even when taking
the standard deviation and standard error into account. We also observed some outliers
for \textit{Ubuntu 22.04} and \textit{NixOS 23.01}, which are due to the
fact that reboot command was issued without the force flag, which will cause
the system to wait until all processes are terminated before rebooting. Further,
we see that \textit{reUpNix} has a faster time to recover than \textit{NixOS 23.01},
which means that the minification process of \textit{reUpNix} does not introduce
delay in the boot process, and the opposite is true.
Our measurements show that \textit{reUpNix} is a viable option for \ac{IoT} devices,
and that the \textit{Nix} package manager does not introduce a significant delay.
\textit{Azure IoT Edge} with its dependencies can be installed and run on
\textit{reUpNix} with a comparable, even better, time to recover as Microsoft's
recommended \textit{Ubuntu 22.04}.

\section{Container Updates}
With the proposed methodology in chapter \ref{sec:container-updates} we were able
to install \ac{OCI}-container images
on an \ac{IoT} device running \textit{reUpNix} without using \code{docker pull}.
We verified that the installed images can be used to run containers with \textit{Docker}
and match the images from \textit{Docker Hub} by comparing the \textit{SHA256} checksums.
Since the images are now stored in the \textit{Nix} store, we used the \textit{reUpNix}
differential update mechanism to install the container images and compared the update size
with the compressed size that would be downloaded with \code{docker pull}. We used
the same compression algorithm (\textit{gzip}) to compress the update artifacts,
as \textit{Docker} uses to compress the container images. With this methodology
we tested the top 10 most pulled images from \textit{Docker Hub} and the results
can be seen in table \ref{tab:container-size} and figure \ref{fig:container-size}.

\noindent
We can see from the results that the \textit{reUpNix} differential update mechanism
is more efficient in installing container image updates than using \code{docker pull}.
For all of the top 10 most pulled images from \textit{Docker Hub}, we can save
transferred data size by using \textit{reUpNix}. Even container images that are
only a few Megabytes in size, like \textit{busybox}, can be transmitted in a more
efficient way with \textit{reUpNix}'s differential update methodology. This means
that using \textit{reUpNix} to install container images on \ac{IoT} devices, is more
efficient than using \code{docker pull} and our proposed methodology can be used
as a replacement which still works with \textit{Azure IoT Edge}.
