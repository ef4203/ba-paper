The growth of the \ac{IoT} in industries like production, manufacturing, and
agriculture has led to a wide range of innovations and new products. Currently
all major cloud providers such as Microsoft, Google, Amazon's AWS and IBM offer
\ac{IoT} services and solutions to their customers. However many \ac{IIoT} devices
which are installed in remote locations, such as offshore oil rigs or airplanes,
have limited, unstable, or costly network connections. Techniques to
minimize the \ac{IIoT} software’s network traffic both in message size
(such as \textit{Protobuf} or other forms of compression), and in message amount
(such as local processing with edge computing) have already been established.
However the image size, update, and consistency of the underlying operating
system is still a challenge. With Microsoft's \textit{Azure IoT Device
Update} service for example, the entire image for the operating system is sent
to the device and then written to a secondary partition. This results in hundreds
of megabytes being transmitted.

In this field study, we investigate if the \textit{NixOS}-based \textit{ReUpNix}
can be used as a suitable host operating system for Microsoft’s commercial
\ac{IoT} platform \textit{Azure IoT Edge}, since its image size is significantly
smaller than Microsoft's recommended Linux images.
Further, we investigate the conceptual advantages for \ac{IoT}
devices that \textit{NixOS}-based systems provide over traditional \textit{Linux}
operating systems, when updating the system. For this, we identified the
minimum set of components and features that have to be added to heavily minified
\textit{ReUpNix} in order to have the required functionality for the
Docker-container-based \textit{Azure IoT Edge}, while remaining at a small
footprint in disk size.

\textbf{[Expected result]}
With \textit{ReUpNix} as a host operating system for \textit{Azure IoT Edge}, we
observed A\% smaller image size due to the minification and B\% smaller size of
system updates due to the fact that only differences are sent, compared to
Microsoft's recommended \textit{Ubuntu 22.04} and a custom \textit{Yocto Linux}
image. Further we showed that it is possible to pre-install Docker container
layers on the device, such that the amount of data that needs to be transmitted
in the case of a container update with \textit{Azure IoT Edge} is heavily reduced.
However \textit{NixOS}-based systems do not receive official support from
Microsoft and product managers need to decide if the benefits outweigh the loss
of Microsoft's support.
